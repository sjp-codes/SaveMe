# Participiant: How to Contribute

1. **Visit the HackNight 6.0 Leaderboard**:
   Browse the leaderboard and choose a repository you'd like to contribute to!

2. **Check for Open Issues**:
   Look for any open issues in the repository. If you find one that interests you, ask to be assigned to it by commenting on the issue. (You can also add issues!)

3. **Setup Your Codebase**:
   - **Fork** the repository to your GitHub account and copy it's clone URL
   - **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine using [Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/set-up-git) (make sure it's installed)

   For this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:acmpesuecc/SaveMe.git
   ```

4. **Make Your Changes**
   After cloning and setting up your branch, make the necessary changes to the code in your IDE.

5. **Commit and Push**:
   Commit your changes and push them to your fork:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Describe the changes you made"
   git push
   ```

   Alternatively, use VSCode's inbuilt Git source control pane `Ctrl+Shift+G` if you're uncomfortable with a CLI

6. **Submit a Pull Request**:
   After pushing your changes, open a pull request to pull changes from your fork to the original repository.

7. **Get Feedback**
   Wait for a maintainer to review your pull request (PR) and provide feedback.

8. **Gain Bounty Points**
   If everything is approved, your issue will be closed, and you'll gain bounty points on the leaderboard!
